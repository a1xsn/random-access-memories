## What Was It

It was our first attempt at building a community-oriented NFT project that prioritized the emotional side over the speculative one. You probably never heard of it, and that's okay â€“ we failed by all metrics of relative success. Nevertheless, I wish to save Bilita's landing page in this repo since it was my first experience building a React project integrated with NFT mechanics. 

Bilita Mpash was developed as a community-building event that includes ERC-1155 collectibles, an interactive narrative-driven metaverse experience made with 8XR technologies, and a digital fashion collection (that unfortunately never materialized). The title "Bilita Mpash" comes from Bantu, a group of African languages. It roughly translates as "amazing, pleasant dream, the opposite of a nightmare."

### Technically, the engineering behind Bilita consists of the following 
    
- a. Landing Page ([React](https://github.com/facebook/react) | [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- b. Minting Interface ([ThirdWeb](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev)) 
- c. Separate Gaming Platform ([8XR Backend](https://8xr.io))

A [CodeBucks video on a typical NFT landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edr2o59Twrs&t=12752s&pp=ygUXY29kZXNvdXJjZSBuZnQgbGFuZGluYmc%3D) inspired the source code for the landing page. 

### How to activate Bilita Mpash these days

To participate in Bilita Mpash, you need a Totem - ERC-1155 collectible NFT on Polygon with five different editions. The user should get The Key to The Island to reveal what kind of Totem he gets.

Later during the reveal, users receive a link to enter The Island using the 8XR gaming platform available across many browsers and devices. For anyone trying to activate the link now, remember to register on the 8XR platform and connect your Metamask wallet with The Totem. Once inside, The Island is yours to explore as a single-player experience. 

### The obvious question: what happened to Bilita Mpash? 

We failed because of lousy release timing and a lack of marketing investments. But most importantly, The Island wasn't interesting enough to truly explore it. We hoped to gather a large community and keep on building new sections of the Island that would culminate in Flowers Festival - a weekend-long multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, these plans were cut off short. Still, Bilita Mpash lives on, at least in this repo.

If you want to experience The Island inside the 8XR gaming platform, DM me anywhere you want to get a Key. It's free, of course. I've got enough of them.
