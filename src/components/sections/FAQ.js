            Although we'll be happy to see Bilita Mpash gain traction on NFT
            marketplaces, our initial intent is the opposite. First and
            foremost, we want to create a narrative experience that propels deep
            emotional reactions and inspires community building of like-minded
            people who appreciate beauty in different forms and manifestations.
